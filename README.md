# Cafe-Corner

The project is a website for a cafe - Caf√© Corner. This website shows information about this place. It has been designed for customers to learn more about the cafe's offer. The graphical interface is clear and legible, so the cafe customer will have no problem finding the information he needs.

Technologies used in the project: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (using jQuery).

The website contains the following subpages: home page, cafe menu, photo gallery of the place and food, contact with the cafe.
Additional features of the project: clock showing the current date and time, on the Menu and Gallery pages I made an animation using the jQuery library, which scrolls the page to the top after pressing the arrow at the bottom of the screen. The arrow at the very top is invisible, it only appears when you scroll down.
